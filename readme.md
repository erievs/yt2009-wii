## updating

if you want to update your frontend instance, use

```
git pull --no-commit
```

to get you up with updates you may have missed.

if you modified the code yourself and you're getting a merge conflict, use

```
git checkout -- <file>
```

to restore the original file. you can make a copy of your modified file and reapply the mod after the pull is done.

## usage

now that you're in, you can just use it as it is, but there is a bit more you can do.

navigate to **/flags** to change settings locally. here, for example, you can set up The Wayback Machine as a video data source. but look through, there is a lot more.

feel free to nav to **/toggle_f** if you've set up flash players as described above to make the frontend work on older browsers, such as ie6.

and just click around! you might find some useful features you didn't expect to work.

**over time, depending on your usage, yt2009 may take up a lot of space (counted in tens of gigabytes!)**

**if you need to reclaim space, look through the assets folder where downloaded files (such as images, videos) are saved and delete ones you need.**

**they will be redownloaded when necessary.**
